   identical scancontact for such cases, which will set the call by reference
   parameters to the contact location.

   The function getcontactref works mostly like getcontact, but it uses a user
   supplied reference to determine which events are new. This allows an
   alternate control flow to parse events that the main program has already
   processed and cleared. The reference must be initialized to zero and will
   be updated by any call to this function. The caller should be aware that
