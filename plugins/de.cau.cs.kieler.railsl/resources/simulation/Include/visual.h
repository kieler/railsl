    visual.h

    This file is intended to be the glue connecting the railway interface to
    program code that maintains a visual representation of the system. You
    must extend this skeleton as needed to make full use of it, the basic
    code only dumps events to standard output.

    Possible solutions include the use of Qt, to communicate via TCP/IP with
    a visualization server, to call methods of a Java GUI and so on...
