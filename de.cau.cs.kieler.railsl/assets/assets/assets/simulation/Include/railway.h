    railway.h

    High level interface to the railway system that hides the nodelink
    communication layer and physical details like the wiring of sensors
    and actuators to specific controller nodes from the user. Instead,
    an abstract view of the whole system is presented, allowing programs
    to address objects with their names and numbers.
